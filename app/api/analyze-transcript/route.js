CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. READ THE ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT CAREFULLY - Do not miss any mentions, references, or examples
2. SEARCH THOROUGHLY for ALL evidence related to each competency, including:
   - Direct mentions of the topic/behavior
   - Indirect references or related examples
   - Stories, anecdotes, or experiences that demonstrate the competency
   - Any relevant context or background information
3. QUOTE SPECIFIC PHRASES from the transcript in your explanations
4. COUNT multiple instances - if something is mentioned several times, note that frequency
5. BE ACCURATE - Double-check your assessment against the actual transcript content

Score each competency using this scale (IMPORTANT: Be conservative with 5s - they should only be given for truly exceptional performance):
- 1 = Poor/No evidence found anywhere in transcript
- 2 = Minimal evidence or concerning examples
- 3 = Some evidence, meets basic expectations
- 4 = Strong evidence with good examples (THIS IS A SOLID, GOOD RATING)
- 5 = EXCEPTIONAL evidence with multiple outstanding examples that clearly exceed expectations (RESERVE FOR TRULY EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE ONLY)

Competencies to evaluate:
${competencyList}

Interview Transcript:
"""
${processedTranscript}
"""

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. For each competency, scan the ENTIRE transcript for ANY mention or relevant example
2. Look for variations of the topic (e.g., for "party" look for: party, partying, social events, celebrations, nightlife, etc.)
3. Count how many times it's mentioned and note the context
4. Quote the specific parts of the transcript that support your score

Provide your response in this JSON format:
{
  "scores": {
    "competency_name": score,
    ...
  },
  "explanations": {
    "competency_name": "Detailed explanation with SPECIFIC QUOTES from transcript showing evidence found. Mention frequency if topic appears multiple times. If no evidence found, state clearly after thorough review.",
    ...
  }
}

Remember: Be thorough, accurate, and quote specific examples from the transcript to support every score.`
