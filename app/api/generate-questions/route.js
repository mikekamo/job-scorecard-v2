COMPETENCIES TO EVALUATE (MUST ALL BE COVERED):
${competencyList}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- These are VIDEO INTERVIEW questions (candidates will record video responses)
- Questions will be analyzed by AI later to score candidates on a 1-5 scale for each competency
- EVERY SINGLE COMPETENCY MUST be addressed by at least one question
- Generate enough questions to ensure complete competency coverage
- Questions should encourage candidates to provide specific examples and detailed responses
- Avoid yes/no questions - focus on experience-revealing questions
- Questions should be answerable within 2-5 minutes each

MANDATORY COMPETENCY COVERAGE:
- EVERY competency must be addressed by at least one question
- Questions can and SHOULD address multiple competencies when they are similar or related
- If two competencies are similar (e.g., "Communication" and "Stakeholder Communication"), one well-crafted question can cover both
- Generate ${Math.max(3, Math.min(competencies.length, 7))} questions - fewer questions are better if they efficiently cover all competencies
- Do not leave any competency unaddressed
- Focus on efficiency: combine related competencies into single questions when possible

QUESTION STRATEGY:
Create a mix of question types that reveal both experience depth and capability:

1. **EXPERIENCE-BASED QUESTIONS (60% of questions):**
   - "What experience do you have with [competency area]?"
   - "Can you walk me through your background in [specific skill]?"
   - "Tell me about your experience with [competency] in previous roles"
   - These should reveal the candidate's actual experience level and background

2. **BEHAVIORAL/SITUATIONAL QUESTIONS (40% of questions):**
   - "Tell me about a time when..." (specific challenging scenarios)
   - "How would you handle..." (problem-solving scenarios)
   - These should test their capability and approach

COMPETENCY MAPPING REQUIREMENT:
- Ensure every competency from the list is addressed by at least one question
- ACTIVELY COMBINE similar competencies into single questions:
  * "Email Marketing" + "Digital Marketing" = One question about digital marketing experience including email campaigns
  * "Communication Skills" + "Stakeholder Communication" = One question about communicating with various stakeholders
  * "Project Management" + "Campaign Management" = One question about managing marketing projects/campaigns
  * "React Development" + "Frontend Development" = One question about frontend development including React
- Questions should be broad enough to evaluate multiple related competencies efficiently
- Prioritize fewer, more comprehensive questions over many narrow ones
- Focus on learning about their background and capability across all competency areas with minimal interview fatigue

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, well-structured question that explores experience and capability
2. An appropriate time limit in seconds (180-300 seconds for experience questions, 120-240 for scenarios)

Generate questions that:
- Reveal the candidate's actual experience level and background in each competency area
- Allow candidates to showcase their relevant work history
- Include specific examples from previous roles
- Mix experience exploration with challenging scenarios
- Are professional and relevant for video interviews
- Provide rich data for 1-5 scoring across competencies

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format:
[
  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex technical problem under pressure. Walk me through your approach and the outcome.",
    "timeLimit": 240
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?",
    "timeLimit": 180
  }
]

Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting - just the JSON array.`
