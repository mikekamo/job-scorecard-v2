COMPETENCIES TO EVALUATE (CREATE ONE QUESTION FOR EACH):
${competencyList}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate EXACTLY ${competencies.length} questions - one for each competency
- Questions will be ordered to match the competency order above
- These are VIDEO INTERVIEW questions (candidates will record video responses)
- Questions will be analyzed by AI later to score candidates on a 1-5 scale for each competency
- Each question MUST directly and specifically target the competency it's meant to evaluate
- Questions must be RELEVANT to the actual competency name and description provided
- Use PROBING techniques that get candidates to reveal their true experience level naturally
- FOCUS ON COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIENCE: Ask about their overall background, not single incidents
- Goal is to assess BREADTH and DEPTH of experience, not just one example

QUESTION DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1. **BE SPECIFIC TO THE COMPETENCY:**
   - For "Technical Skills" ‚Üí Ask about their technical experience, projects, tools
   - For "Communication" ‚Üí Ask about explaining, presenting, or discussing complex topics
   - For "Problem Solving" ‚Üí Ask about analyzing, troubleshooting, or working through challenges  
   - For "Leadership" ‚Üí Ask about guiding others, making decisions, or taking initiative
   - For "Organizational Skills" ‚Üí Ask about managing time, priorities, systems, or processes
   - For "Team Collaboration" ‚Üí Ask about working with others, contributing to group success

2. **USE PROBING TECHNIQUES (DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ANSWER):**
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Walk me through your experience with managing projects"
   ‚ùå BAD: "Tell me about a time you used your project management skills"
   
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "What's your background with handling multiple priorities?"
   ‚ùå BAD: "How do you use your organizational skills when managing deadlines?"
   
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Describe your experience troubleshooting complex issues"
   ‚ùå BAD: "Tell me about a time when you had to use your problem-solving abilities"

3. **QUESTION STARTERS THAT WORK (PRIORITIZE EXPERIENCE-BASED):**
   - "What's your experience with..." (assesses breadth and depth - PREFERRED)
   - "Walk me through your background in..." (gets comprehensive overview - PREFERRED)
   - "Describe your experience handling..." (reveals full capability range - PREFERRED)
   - "How do you typically approach..." (reveals methods and experience)
   - "Tell me about your work with..." (gets professional background)
   
   AVOID these narrow starters:
   - "Tell me about a time..." (too limiting to one example)
   - "Describe a situation where..." (too specific)

4. **AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
   - Don't mention the competency name in the question
   - Don't use leading phrases like "using your [skill]"
   - Don't give hints about what good answers look like
   - Don't ask yes/no questions
   - Don't make questions too narrow or specific

EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS BY COMPETENCY TYPE:

**Technical Skills:**
- "What's your experience with [specific technology/tools mentioned in job]?"
- "Walk me through your background in software development and the types of projects you've worked on"

**Communication:**
- "Describe your experience presenting or explaining technical concepts to different audiences"
- "What's your background with written and verbal communication in professional settings?"

**Problem Solving:**
- "Walk me through your approach to troubleshooting complex issues you encounter in your work"
- "What's your experience with analyzing and solving challenging problems?"

**Leadership:**
- "Describe your experience leading projects or influencing outcomes without formal authority"
- "What's your background with guiding teams or mentoring others?"

**Organizational Skills:**
- "Walk me through how you manage competing priorities and deadlines in your work"
- "Describe your experience with coordinating multiple projects or tasks simultaneously"

**Team Collaboration:**
- "What's your experience working in collaborative team environments?"
- "Describe your approach to contributing to team success across different types of projects"

**Travel/Logistics (like the user's example):**
- "What's your experience with handling travel logistics and arrangements?"
- "Walk me through your background with coordinating transportation and accommodations"

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, probing question that will naturally reveal the competency level
2. An appropriate time limit in seconds (180-300 seconds)
3. Make sure the question directly relates to the specific competency name and description provided

Generate questions that:
- Are directly relevant to each specific competency
- Focus on OVERALL EXPERIENCE rather than single incidents
- Allow candidates to showcase their full range of capabilities
- Use natural, conversational language that doesn't telegraph what you're looking for
- Encourage comprehensive responses about their background and approach
- Will reveal authentic competency levels across their experience
- Are professional and appropriate for video interviews
- Give candidates room to discuss multiple examples and demonstrate expertise depth

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format (maintain the same order as the competencies):
[
  {
    "question": "What's your experience with project management and the types of projects you've worked on?",
    "timeLimit": 240
  },
  {
    "question": "Walk me through your background with coordinating multiple tasks and managing logistics",
    "timeLimit": 180
  }
]

Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting - just the JSON array.`

COMPETENCIES TO EVALUATE (MUST ALL BE COVERED):
${competencyList}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- These are VIDEO INTERVIEW questions (candidates will record video responses)
- Questions will be analyzed by AI later to score candidates on a 1-5 scale for each competency
- EVERY SINGLE COMPETENCY MUST be addressed by at least one question
- Generate enough questions to ensure complete competency coverage
- Questions should encourage candidates to provide specific examples and detailed responses
- Avoid yes/no questions - focus on experience-revealing questions
- Questions should be answerable within 2-5 minutes each

MANDATORY COMPETENCY COVERAGE:
- EVERY competency must be addressed by at least one question
- Questions can and SHOULD address multiple competencies when they are similar or related
- If two competencies are similar (e.g., "Communication" and "Stakeholder Communication"), one well-crafted question can cover both
- Generate ${Math.max(3, Math.min(competencies.length, 7))} questions - fewer questions are better if they efficiently cover all competencies
- Do not leave any competency unaddressed
- Focus on efficiency: combine related competencies into single questions when possible

QUESTION STRATEGY:
Create a mix of question types that reveal both experience depth and capability:

1. **EXPERIENCE-BASED QUESTIONS (60% of questions):**
   - "What experience do you have with [competency area]?"
   - "Can you walk me through your background in [specific skill]?"
   - "Tell me about your experience with [competency] in previous roles"
   - These should reveal the candidate's actual experience level and background

2. **BEHAVIORAL/SITUATIONAL QUESTIONS (40% of questions):**
   - "Tell me about a time when..." (specific challenging scenarios)
   - "How would you handle..." (problem-solving scenarios)
   - These should test their capability and approach

COMPETENCY MAPPING REQUIREMENT:
- Ensure every competency from the list is addressed by at least one question
- ACTIVELY COMBINE similar competencies into single questions:
  * "Email Marketing" + "Digital Marketing" = One question about digital marketing experience including email campaigns
  * "Communication Skills" + "Stakeholder Communication" = One question about communicating with various stakeholders
  * "Project Management" + "Campaign Management" = One question about managing marketing projects/campaigns
  * "React Development" + "Frontend Development" = One question about frontend development including React
- Questions should be broad enough to evaluate multiple related competencies efficiently
- Prioritize fewer, more comprehensive questions over many narrow ones
- Focus on learning about their background and capability across all competency areas with minimal interview fatigue

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, well-structured question that explores experience and capability
2. An appropriate time limit in seconds (180-300 seconds for experience questions, 120-240 for scenarios)

Generate questions that:
- Reveal the candidate's actual experience level and background in each competency area
- Allow candidates to showcase their relevant work history
- Include specific examples from previous roles
- Mix experience exploration with challenging scenarios
- Are professional and relevant for video interviews
- Provide rich data for 1-5 scoring across competencies

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format:
[
  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex technical problem under pressure. Walk me through your approach and the outcome.",
    "timeLimit": 240
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?",
    "timeLimit": 180
  }
]

Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting - just the JSON array.`
