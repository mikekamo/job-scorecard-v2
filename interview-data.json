It's like on the beach and there's like, you know, good food and all that fun stuff. And then we came to London for the last part and this is where uh it's still vacation for the family but I'm working. So it's not as fun for me.\n\n01:50 But uh what is another place?

I never travel out from Brazil for other\n\n02:40 Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n02:42 Outside of Brazil?\n\n02:43 Yes, outside of Brazil.\n\n02:45 Have you traveled a lot? Have you traveled a lot inside of Brazil?\n\n02:50 I go to not not much. Uh for sometimes it's more cheap travel for another country.\n\n03:00 Mhm.\n\n03:02 In my country for we have a big country so I don't know if you know but the the Nor Nor West, Nordeste. It's a city that great beaches and great food. It's very how do I say?\n\n03:22 Expensive?\n\n03:23 Expensive to travel to there so I never go but I go for Rio de Janeiro.\n\n03:30 Yes. Yeah.\n\n03:32 Rio de Janeiro is a very very famous city and last that I see that that I see that I was born in Sao Paulo.\n\n03:42 Do you live you live in Sao Paulo?\n\n03:45 Yes, I live in Sao Paulo for about 50 years.\n\n03:49 Nice. Yeah, I've been to Brazil like three or maybe four times.\n\n03:53 Oh, what what city you go?\n\n03:57 Only Sao Paulo every time.\n\n04:00 Only Sao Paulo.\n\n04:00 Yeah, but I I work with a lot of Brazilians and um most of them actually live in Belo Horizonte but when I come there too. Yeah, but when I go to Brazil to meet them for work, we meet in Sao Paulo because a lot of the clients are are there in Sao Paulo. It's like very I mean you know, it's a very like big business capital for Brazil.\n\n04:21 Yes.\n\n04:22 Yeah. So um I I really like Brazil and uh the culture and the language but uh I think it's a very pretty very beautiful language.\n\n04:31 Yes, is very here we have a lot of diversity and a lot of in some here in Sao Paulo, we have the all foods of the place of the country. Here in Sao Paulo so it's a very good place. I I like to it's a little chaotic chaotic.\n\n04:54 Yeah, chaotic. Yeah.\n\n04:56 Yeah, I live in Sao Paulo so I don't live in downtown but I like it. It's have a lot of things to do and explore so it's okay. But sometimes I go to I I I don't know how to say this but there's some Paulo and there are another cities around Sao Paulo is\n\n05:22 I don't know how to say this thing in English. Sorry.\n\n05:25 Yeah, no, that's okay. That's okay.\n\n05:27 Um well, let's uh I actually prepared some questions if you want to start what we can do is maybe I can ask some questions to get to know you a little bit better and then you can ask me questions also and you can, you know, ask to get to know me and our family better too. Does that sound good?\n\n05:44 Okay.\n\n05:45 Oh, I I want to say your kid is so cute.\n\n05:51 Thank you. I know he is so cute. He's like his hair is just crazy. It's so so red. It's so red.\n\n05:59 I know. Well, he's because of I I oh my god, he's so cute.\n\n06:04 Thank you.\n\n06:05 Yeah, I know. He's so cute. We don't want him to we don't want him to grow up. He's like he's perfect the way he is.\n\n06:12 No. I couldn't imagine. But you you can ask me what you what are the questions?\n\n06:21 Sure. Okay. Um so let me start with the first one is um if maybe you can share like a time when you um went out of your way to help someone. Maybe if it's a friend or a family member or a stranger but like, you know, what did it what what had what happened and like what did you do kind of to help them?\n\n06:45 What I do? Oh, I am a very open person for and I I for admitting. I am a teacher so I am always helping the people because my students they need a lot of a lot of help. But I I don't I I I think like think I think that I not to I no I cannot put in words because my English is not so good but let me think that this is a very good question. In Portuguese, I you are you manage better.\n\n07:29 Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n07:31 Okay.\n\n07:31 When my mother oh yeah, go ahead. helps she when I see she needs help sometimes they don't she don't ask but I see she need helps I go and help with my students. I think is sometimes people people uh they are they need help but they don't know how to you know? Is uh talk.\n\n08:00 Yeah.\n\n08:02 And you need to see you need to be a people uh person to the environment, you know? They look the environment and oh this people I can help. So I'm always open to I am a very talking person so I always oh how are you? What you doing and with my students I when I as a nanny with the family as a nanny and always oh what you what you're doing because the my my last time when I was a nanny is February, January, February, March, March. I was a nanny for Nina and Juan. And Nina she was very jealous of Juan because Nina was the baby for the house and Juan Juan was one year and Nina was four years. So Nina was very frustrated, you know? She was very sad because jealous, you know? It's very normal when kids have another brother they and I see this because I take a lot of time with her and their parents work a lot. So uh for help she I I sit with their parents and I talk. Nina need need attention. You need to go out with Nina only you retreat and Juan will stay with me because I I felt, you know, that she she she she was sad and the she was very angry with Juan and this she this help a lot this conversation. That have conversation is very important.\n\n10:00 P\n\n10:00 Because I I'm talking person so that open you know open conversation is very important. So I I responded your question. Sorry for that.\n\n10:13 No, it's okay.\n\n10:15 But I I I am I am always say that I am a people pleaser.\n\n10:21 Uh-huh. Okay.\n\n10:23 Um so the next question that I have for you is um sorry, where did it go? There you go. Um okay, so like what are your your current like responsibilities in your life whether you're in school or working or also at home, like maybe you have if you live with your parents, like maybe you have certain responsibilities in the house like you are in charge of grocery shopping or I don't know. But like what I guess like what are your current life responsibilities?\n\n10:56 So I work in two schools. So I work in the morning, sometimes I work at night and sometimes I work afternoon. In the morning I always work some Monday at Friday always working, but at night and afternoon at some days of the week. So I have this responsibility responsibility with my students because I am a teacher for sixth grade and the high school. I teach Portuguese language.\n\n11:32 Okay.\n\n11:33 So I have the the the activities and evaluations and always because they they can be very very difficult sometimes, but yeah. But I always talk to them. So I have this responsibility in my house. Now I live with my parents. I don't live with with with there for about six or five years.\n\n12:08 Okay.\n\n12:08 I live a lot of people. I live with I live two years with my sister and my nephew. I live two years with my ex-boyfriend and I live one year with two friends. So I live uh so this made a lot of sense independence and the house and you know because when I when I go out of my house parents, I don't know. I have no idea what what is a life. I I was 29. 29 years. I have 29 and now 29, no.\n\n12:47 19.\n\n12:49 19, yes. 19 now 26. And here in my house, the responsibility that I have, I live with my parents and my oldest nephew. We divide the bedroom, the you know the how they say this? The chores.\n\n13:12 Yeah.\n\n13:14 Oh, you you divide or you split like you you split the chores?\n\n13:18 So like one week one two weeks uh we we we\n\n13:26 Sorry, I forgot the word. We sleep uh separate the\n\n13:32 So like one week one week you do the you do the chores and then one week your nephew does the chores?\n\n13:38 Yes, like this. But here here\n\n13:42 What are the chores that you do?\n\n13:45 Yes. Here my family has uh communication very well. So my dad, he is always cooking. He this is his responsibility. I don't I know how to cook, but he he has their routine. So sometimes I go to the groceries and sometimes my nephew. They think is about me and my nephew because he now is 19. Yes, 19. So he he I grow up. So I can talk with them and I of course my bedroom is all of my responsibilities and do the dishes, the the trash and sometimes vacuum the the house. So it's very flexible, you know? My with me and my nephew, my my mother, she don't do anything because she she gave me and my nephew. So I think is I think is very just because she work a lot and she she has she has a she is a very good mom. So that is not bother bother me. And when I was living with my sister, we divide the tasks. When I live with the two friends, divide the tasks too. And when I live with my ex-boyfriend, I remember that he don't like to vacuum and the the apartment. So this is my responsibility and he do the dishes. So responsibilities in the house is very okay for me because I I live with another people. I live uh from the house of my parents. So I know that when we are adults, we have the obligations.\n\n15:53 Uh-huh.\n\n15:54 That makes sense. Okay.\n\n15:56 Um the next question I have is for um let me see where is it?\n\n16:10 Sorry, I'm trying to find it. Oh, here. Okay.\n\n16:12 Problem. How how would how would your friends describe you?\n\n16:19 My parents?\n\n16:20 Your friends and or your parents. Either one. But maybe they both will describe you different. So maybe you can tell me how how will your parents and how will your friends?\n\n16:29 I think they they describe me very we call. My friends are definitely they describe me of a humor humor person, humor is Yes, you know, I always make jokes and everybody laughs. So I'm this type of person. And my my parents, I am the person that when have a fight, I oh calm down, sit down and so up more communication. I work with kids so patience and calm. I work with kids about four years now. So if I don't have the patience, don't work with kids, you know? Don't work with kids because kids need the patience. So yeah, yeah. I think\n\n17:25 But and my dad, she my I have a older sister. She has she was she has eight years uh above me and parents see me I the youngest and my my dad always see me the more responsible.\n\n17:48 Okay. Daughter. So you're the younger you're the younger one but more responsible.\n\n17:54 Yes, they always see me. When I start this this idea of the program, my dad says, okay, you I can I can the confidence that you you know to travel in another country. But Amanda and Lucas, this my brothers, I don't\n\n18:18 That's funny.\n\n18:20 Yeah, yeah.\n\n18:22 Yes, I and my friends uh I am I am a very talk person. I very easy for make friends. They already say that I if they is is if they is if I if I do anything alone, I make a friend. It's not matter I know the people when they five five uh is they sometimes we uh like when we go out to bars or or or concerts in the the bathroom, I make friends. And they don't know with in the bathroom is bathroom, bathroom. I make friends. So they me like this. I think.\n\n19:17 Yes.\n\n19:18 Okay, nice.\n\n19:20 Um cool. And then um I guess I'll maybe ask like only a little bit more about you and then more so questions like related to the baby.\n\n19:31 Okay, no problem.\n\n19:32 So this questions, I guess these questions are more like on a personal level because if you're going to like you live with somebody, I think it's important to know these things. Um so I guess what I wanted to ask is like how often do you like to go out drinking alcohol, you know, like partying. And it's okay if you like to. I think a lot of people do, you know. Um but um you know, I think it's more so like how often do you like\n\n20:00 To do that or if you like to if you do drugs and I think the concern is for us is like if it will impact your ability to watch the baby. You know what I mean?\n\n20:10 Yes.\n\n20:11 Yes, no, definitely. It's very good questions. You know, I I gonna be honest with you. I I drink alcohol. I go out about two one I I stay a lot of home because I like to watch movies and read books and because I I work a lot. So I can I need the rest and for me and so but when I when I never because I I like to ride a bike and go to museums and go to concerts. So when I go to bars or I don't know how to say this the clubs, yeah. Night club bars, yeah. drink but not you know, every weekend. I know that people do this but I don't know I don't I don't do drugs and I don't smoke too. Only when I go out with my friends. It's not every weekend but one one weekend at the month I think I go out because it for me is very do the night, you know, spend the whole night in the party is very only in the carnival.\n\n21:39 Yeah, yeah. I know carnival. Yeah.\n\n21:42 Is another so because in carnival we have the whole weekend whole week in the party. So you don't have to work the next day.\n\n21:54 Yes, so it's different. But I am very responsible with this because when we work with kids, we need to be attention principal and the little kids, you know, I was a kindergarten teacher and I I stay with 24 kids. So I always what is doing. That's a lot of kids.\n\n22:24 Wow.\n\n22:25 24.\n\n22:27 So I always you know, so it's not a a big deal for me alcohol and these things.\n\n22:35 Okay. That makes sense. And then um as far as like I'm trying to think if I have anything else for you like\n\n22:48 I do have one more. I guess let me ask this one first and then I'll ask about the the baby. So when you think about when you think about finding like a host family that resonates with your values, what comes to mind? Like what's important to you in who you you know, become the host family with?\n\n23:08 In this process, I value open communication is very important because I see me like I grow up I an adult. So I can talk. I can if you have one problem with me, you can sit down with me and Anna, this is not work for me. You can do this. I like to to feedback too because it's important to me know that I the thing that I have made is work for both and I see it for me important to feel the how do I say this the that I can talk with my host family, you know, that I have a problem. I create a connection is very important to me too. When I was a nanny, I was nanny three times and I have an amazing relationship with the parents and with the kids. We always talk and so it's very a team team team effort.\n\n24:16 Team. Team. Team effort.\n\n24:19 Yes, so it's very and I think is a respectful family. I think uh the family that see me that not oh, this is Anna and this is our nanny. See me like yes, Anna is here for a culture exchange. She she is part of the family too, you know, because I go out of my country. I live another house with another people and another routine. So it's very a big a big transition.\n\n24:57 Yeah.\n\n24:58 So we have this comfort in my family is very important to me too.\n\n25:05 Okay.\n\n25:07 Let me think. People can enjoy my free time and respect when I I don't because sometimes I I want to be in my bedroom, you know, and watch my movies and do my things. I don't want the host family see this like, oh, Anna don't want to spend time with us. I want but sometimes I want spend time only with me.\n\n25:38 Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.\n\n25:40 The the family know and like meeting I think is more like this, you know, because I I always saying for the girls that this program, my friends on this program that we only uh we only how knew how the things are going when I in here in your house and their routine and we we we know we knew we know each other. You know, so I think the the major things is this the open communication, respectful respectful for persons and and and they they they people that feel happy with my job because I know this job. I know the I I care for your baby is very important to me. The the confidence with me because I will we will stay with your kid and it's a very big job.\n\n26:59 Mhm.\n\n27:00 So I think this this\n\n27:03 That's good. That's really good. I think um I'll just say one thing about that which is the open communication. This is like the only way that I know how to communicate because I uh I own a company and I have a lot of employees. And so when you're a owner of a business, you have to have conversations with your employees all the time. So there's going to be there's going to be times like all the time there's a time where the employee does something that they shouldn't have done or that I want them to do it a different way. And so I have to sit with them and you know, have an adult conversation and say like, hey, here's here's some feedback. Here's how, you know, I would like to see you do it. A very respectful conversation, but you have to do that because if you don't have these conversations, people don't know that you're not happy with them. And you don't want that.\n\n27:53 Yeah.\n\n27:54 You don't want people to be to be, you know, you could tell that there's a problem, but you don't know what's going on. You need to you need to know what's going on. And so in my company we have this way of communication that we call it radical candor in English. So I looked at the translation for you cuz I don't know if you are familiar with it, but in Portuguese it's Frank Franqueza, Franqueza radical.\n\n28:21 Oh.\n\n28:23 Yeah.\n\n28:24 It's very good this.\n\n28:26 So it's yeah, to be like it's to be basically really be very honest with people about how you about with your communication. Because then you can have a better healthier relationship, I think, at least.\n\n28:39 Yes, and I think in this program, if you don't have this communication, doesn't work because I know I know this program a lot of years. I know this program when I was 19. So it's a whole book like I gave the gave the experience and the English and now I I okay, I do this. But I see a lot of posts in Facebook. I think you know that we have a lot of groups of parents families and sometimes I read and think if you sit with the host family or the parents, you can you can talk about this and you know, so it's very important to me.\n\n29:27 Yeah, absolutely. No, I agree.\n\n29:30 Okay, um so then moving on to the baby. Um what would a normal day with Cash like what what would it look like for you? Like what would you want to do on, you know, a typical day? What are some ideas or things that you would like to do with them?\n\n29:48 So I Cash what she he is one.\n\n29:53 Yeah.\n\n29:54 Like a 13 months or one one year, one month.\n\n29:58 Oh, she's so little.\n\n30:02 So when I was working with Juan, Juan was one and a half, so I think it's more like the routine that I have with Juan. When I go to the home, he always wake up because he wake up 5:00 a.m. every day.\n\n30:23 Wow.\n\n30:24 So early.\n\n30:24 Early.\n\n30:25 Yes. I really like to spend time outdoors with the kids because for me, very important to kids go outside and see things and the communication, not communication but interaction with other kids, you know. For me it's very I think it's very important. And I think it's routine with kids. It's very important too. So I I he already eating, so I I see myself waking and making his his breakfast, breakfast, right?\n\n30:55 Yeah. Yeah.\n\n30:56 And and then sitting on the toys and I like to read. I like to read a lot for kids. I think it's very when I Max nanny, he he was four months and I always reading and now he well he has four years and he loves books and now he said that I read.\n\n31:29 Yeah.\n\n31:31 I read.\n\n31:32 Nice.\n\n31:34 So I I can see me reading for then and and create activities for the development of him that I see on internet and always when I was Max nanny, when I was Juan nanny, I always oh how the activities for this age, you know.\n\n31:56 Mhm.\n\n31:57 And go for walks and I don't know if you have because he is very little, so I don't know if you have when I was Max nanny, we have the the swimming classes that I take him and sometimes Juan will have music classes and these things, but if you don't, it's not a problem. I can see me dancing with then because dance is very I think it's very important to kids because they they\n\n32:35 Yeah.\n\n32:36 You know. And that meeting and with the I know that you are in Las Vegas, so it's very hot, right?\n\n32:48 Only in the summer, it's very hot in the summer. It's like summer, it's so hot. It's it's hotter than Sao Paulo, but only but only in the summer. And then after the summer, the weather I think is really good for all all of the year. Just the summer is really bad.\n\n33:04 This is so walking in the parks. I don't know if it's okay for you that they help her go out with\n\n33:12 Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, it is.\n\n33:15 So exploring the city, go to I think it's the out part in the areas, go to events for the babies and he can of his communication, interact with other kids.\n\n33:33 And loving, of course. I love babies, I love children. So and be patient with them because this age is very they don't when they they are gone two years is very crazy.\n\n33:53 Yeah.\n\n33:54 Two years when they have two years, they be a little crazy. So this you know, helping him with the what he needs, changing diapers, giving the food. I this routine is very I can see me doing this thing because in March, I was doing these things with Juan. He was one and a half, so it's similar age.\n\n35:34 Yeah.\n\n35:35 And have a good good great time together. He was my little best friend. We do all things together. So I want to do this with guys too.\n\n35:48 Nice. That's great. That's really good.\n\n35:51 I I have more, but I I feel like I'm taking up too many questions and I should give you some to ask me, so not a\n\n35:59 I don't.\n\n36:01 So let well let's pause on mine and then you can ask me anything. By the way, we're like very open, open book. So if you have anything you want to know, we will share with you like you. There's nothing that I'm not comfortable to answer. It's important like you know exactly, you know, who you're meeting and what you're getting yourself into. And so I think, you know, anything you want to know, just feel free to ask and I'm happy to share.\n\n36:25 Yeah, so I you you it was the first time that you have an out part?\n\n36:31 Yeah, we have never done it. First time.\n\n36:34 No. Why you want to do want to do this program?\n\n36:40 So I have a friend in Vegas who has had four now, four his kids. Like he's done it four times, I think like, you know, each one was one year or two years or, you know, whatever, however long. And he said it was amazing. Like, you know, he basically kind of got me interested by telling me what he thought. And then I met with my like, I don't know you call them like regional manager. Like it's like the person, the lady in in Vegas who she runs this program on the website where I met met you. And so she like explained to me how it all works. And so I guess I can tell you like for me, like what I'm interested and for us is like one we we do need the help, you know, like we could we could use the help of somebody to help with the baby. Two, we want them to learn another language. And so I love Portuguese. Even I want to learn Portuguese. I don't speak like any. Like I can say like to the Ben and like the small, like really nothing. But like we also are interested in the language, but I think it's really good for them at their age to learn it. Three, three like I grew up like in a family where my parents were like never around, like because they were working. Like my dad, he was always worked. Like he started work at he would start work before I wake up in the morning, so I wouldn't see him when I would get up. He was already gone. And then he would come home after I went to sleep. So it was like we lived in the same house, but we never saw each other. So what I ended up happening is I would spend a lot of time with other families. Like my friends, I would stay be at their houses every night and have dinner at my friends' families' houses and, you know, holidays and all these things because my family was not close. And so when I got when I became an adult, I always loved to like welcome my friends into my home who didn't have their family around. And so to me this is like somebody gets to come in, we welcome them into our home and they get to be like a part of our family. And it feels good for me. I think it's because I had that experience when I was a kid, so like it feels good to give that experience to somebody else. And we do like a lot of fun stuff as a family, you know, like we travel a lot, like we eat at really good restaurants and we do a lot of fun things. So like I think we have like really really fun lives. Because I like I work from my computer, so I could work anywhere in the world and you know, I choose my hours and my wife doesn't work. So she spends a lot of time with the baby.\n\n39:23 Yeah.\n\n39:24 I know like we don't we we she could just we don't necessarily need the help, but I mean we do we do we we like it, you know. But yeah, like I think we're we're excited to just like bring somebody in and have them get to experience like what we have. Share and share that with them.\n\n39:43 Yeah, I I like this program because kids in the when I when he is a little, he she he they they they the language\n\n40:00 P\n\n40:00 For then it's so easy. I know one family that have a pair. She is Brazilian and she got and the family the baby was one year and now he has two or three, I don't remember and he speaks Portuguese.\n\n40:20 Wow, that's so cool.\n\n40:22 I think it's amazing because she when she go to this family, the English for her is very she don't speak nothing. So she always say I only have my baby, so I always speak Portuguese with them.\n\n40:43 Yeah.\n\n40:44 So the language for kids is very I always say to my mom, why you don't English class when I was a little baby because now it's very difficult for me.\n\n40:57 Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, for sure, same for me. Like I'm half I'm half Mexican and my mom like they never spoke anything but English. And then once I turned like maybe five or six years old, then my mom tried tried to speak Spanish to me and I would get so mad. I would just cry because I didn't understand her and I didn't want to learn because I was too stubborn at five years old. But if you teach them when they're babies, like they don't know any language yet, so it's like, you know.\n\n41:26 It's amazing. So when I was a and Nina and Manny, they had classes for another teacher in English and sometimes I practiced my English with them. It's it's so I think it's so cool. And definitely I I you need time with your wife to go out and do things because babies can be a lot of energy, you know.\n\n41:55 Yeah, yeah.\n\n41:58 So I definitely and this and what you what are your expectation expectation for our pair? What do what do you, you know, want there do with their baby and your your family?\n\n42:16 Yeah. Yeah, so I think um I'm just curious. I wanted to ask you like are you able to see the the like the letter or the things that I wrote about our profile?\n\n42:28 Yes, yes, I I\n\n42:29 Okay, cool. Okay. Good, that's good. Um so yeah, for us, I think like one is we do want someone who will work the 45 hours, I think is what it is um a week. Um there might be uh if if he starts going to some type of school like preschool, um it would probably be like, you know, maybe one time or two times a week and so on those days maybe have to work like a split uh shift. And then I guess our expectations would be like um I'm trying to think I actually like wrote some stuff down too. So let's see. Um as far as child care goes, it's like kind of like what you said. Like we want him to be outside a lot. We want him to get a lot of love and attention. Like, you know, when we thought about this, like my wife is a very loving person. And so like she doesn't want somebody who is like too serious, you know, where they maybe they're very responsible, but like they don't smile and like have a lot of fun. She wants someone who's like that, who smiles a lot and gives love to the to him. She thinks it's really important. Um and so giving him love, attention and teaching him. And so I think that was interesting how you said like you'll just use the internet to figure out like what should you teach a baby this age. Like that's great. That's that's exactly the way to do it, you know, find exercises or ways to expand their brain, you know, develop the brain. Um including a second language. So including Portuguese.\n\n44:07 Well, I'll check. Hey. Did you put him to sleep?\n\n44:12 Oh, can you just say hi really fast? Oh, he's still awake.\n\n44:15 Hi. Are you?\n\n44:17 I can't hear you cuz I have headphones in, but you got to take care of them.\n\n44:21 Okay. All right.\n\n44:24 Okay, it's okay. Next time.\n\n44:28 He's still taking care of them, sorry.\n\n44:31 I I I can imagine that. I I I have one question. Uh you do simply sleep training?\n\n44:41 Yes, we did. Yes.\n\n44:43 Because it's very difficult for in Brazil we take the baby and we Oh no. dance with the baby.\n\n44:51 No, no. We did like a sleep training when he was four months old and he slept he sleeps so well. He sleeps like amazing. He sleeps from about 7:30 p.m. until 6:30 a.m. every day. And he almost doesn't he almost never wakes up in the middle of the night. On this trip, it's been a little bit more difficult because of time zone change and different environment. But he's still even on this trip, he's doing pretty well. But at home, he sleeps like super super well because we have him like on a very very specific schedule.\n\n45:23 Yeah. Yes, because here no, I was I think that I with Juan it's very difficult because when she he has they sleep when he was you know, oh, I want to sleep but the baby more want to sleep. More don't want to sleep. They always fight to to sleep. So I think it's very very cool this situation. I never do it. I never do it because in Brazil we don't\n\n45:57 Yeah.\n\n45:58 Now they when I asked Max Manny, he have one routine very straight, you know, the naps and the bottles and the food when he started food eat. So and he sleeps the whole whole night. So\n\n46:18 I think it's very interesting thing. And I I have pedagogy. I don't know if you know what is that, but pedagogy is pedagogy in Portuguese is for kids for preschool, kindergarten until sixth grade. And in the degree we we don't know the how do what I do with this baby. I I how I have the practice. I I know a lot, but development, you know, we studied psychologist psychology psychology\n\n47:05 Of kids. So it's very interesting course course for kids. And I have the Portuguese language.\n\n47:16 Okay, nice.\n\n47:18 Yeah, that's great. Um so yeah, just to add to what what to answer your question more, like the child care stuff would be like you said, it would be taking him to the park, taking him out to do things, maybe he learn to learn swimming. He doesn't know how to swim yet, so maybe that. But um interacting him with other kids, also really important. And then as far as like the house, I would say the most of the things will be related to him. So like keeping his room, you know, clean, keeping his play area clean, uh preparing food for him, uh his laundry, his dishes, his dishes are going to be like bottles and like, you know, the little plates and stuff. But like when it comes to like cleaning the house, like we have cleaners. And we don't really need you to like clean our like we're not looking for somebody to clean our house for us, you know, like we're not looking for a house cleaner. Um but we are clean, like especially my wife, she's very clean. So I think it's important like to clean up after yourself. So, you know, if you cook something in the kitchen, like do put the dishes in the dishwasher, you know, of your like your stuff and like don't leave a mess, you know what I mean?\n\n48:28 Um and then yeah.\n\n48:30 Yeah, and then I would say maybe like contributing to some like like things around the house like that. Maybe sometimes you get groceries or this or that or whatever, but like I would say nothing like nothing that's going to be like feel like a lot or extensive. So there's that and then driving. I don't know how much comfort you have with driving because I think you you got your license recently, right?\n\n48:54 Yes, I I how do I say this? I I I don't know if you know, but the process for get a driver's license in Brazil is very we have the the classes in the room, we have practical classes.\n\n49:13 Mhm.\n\n49:14 So it's hard to get the license?\n\n49:16 Yes. I started driving in August of the last year. So it's very recently, but I am I I I drive about two and three times in week. I go to school, I go to school of my mother. My mother she's a teacher, so I go to do groceries because I want to improve my my skills of of driving. I consider me a safe driver. I like to drive. I'm not a strong driver because I I drive recently. But I I think I I I I am a safe driver. I\n\n50:00 Drive with responsibility. My dad always saying you you you you how do he how do I say this in English? When I start to drive, he always my my brother, he have a driver's license but he don't drive. And I don't want to like him, so I always improving and doing better. And I think it's very okay because when I start driving, my mother, she never she see me and the the car and I don't I don't go with Anna. And now I I go to the her school and back to the house and for going the city with her. So if she is comfortable with me driving, I think I am very good.\n\n50:57 Good. That's good, yeah.\n\n50:59 Yeah, we would want you to also what I mean we can help you with thing, but it's not hard in Vegas. There's not a lot of traffic and their roads are very big. So there's a lot of space.\n\n51:11 Here in Sao Paulo, I think you know the traffic is crazy.\n\n51:15 It's crazy.\n\n51:16 No, it's not like that a lot.\n\n51:18 There's like no traffic almost almost no traffic in Vegas.\n\n51:23 Okay. Is there I think I answered my question like pretty well there. I don't think there's much left to on my questions. Do you have other questions up?\n\n51:33 And then let me how the routine of the cash is they they have classes or\n\n51:47 Right now, he has no school or classes. I think he's a little too young. I think like so he's 13 months and I think maybe when he's like a little bit closer to two years old is when we'll put him in some type of school. So maybe like 18 or 20 months or something. But even if when he does go to some school there, that at that age, it will be very little, you know.\n\n52:11 Yes.\n\n52:12 Just just a little bit to give him exposure to other kids. And then so his routine now is like he gets up in the morning and he currently takes two naps. So he gets up, let's say at like 6:30, 7:00 a.m. He's up until like 11:00 and he has breakfast and then you know goes for a walk and does whatever stuff, plays with toys, read to him, all these things. Then he goes that to for a nap for like an hour and a half. And then he's up again for like three and a half more hours and then he goes for one more nap and then he's up again from like 4:00 p.m. to\n\n53:04 Oh, sorry. I called and I was you know\n\n53:13 You hit the wrong button.\n\n53:15 Yes.\n\n53:16 No problem.\n\n53:18 Yeah, so then he he is awake again from like 4:00 p.m. to like 7:30, 8:00 p.m. then he goes to sleep. And so right now like you have to just find ways to give him things to do because he doesn't have anything like set on his schedule, you know. So like one thing we do is we go to this place, it's called Kids Empire and it's like a giant indoor facility that has like all these things for the kids like slides and ball pits and things to climb and like it's really cool. So we'll take him there and he loves it there.\n\n53:54 He he already walk?\n\n53:58 Almost. He can probably take like he takes like maybe six or seven steps and then he just he tries to grab grabs something.\n\n54:05 Yes, when I was Joan and when I start he don't he don't walk and we have a lot of exercise because you you are always you walk, you walk. So I put hand and uh I in the I I I forgot but I always he made the six steps and follow he made this a lot and sometimes he go walking.\n\n54:35 Yeah, yeah. He's really close. So he's getting there. But yeah, I think his routine his daily routine is like very unstructured. The only thing that's very structured is his naps. Like it will we use an app on the phone that tells you exactly what time to put him to bed like every single time. So it's really easy. You just follow the app and it says, okay, time for him to go in the crib and you put him in the crib and he maybe he maybe cries for like one minute and then he goes to sleep.\n\n55:05 Oh, this is this is incredible. I need see this because I never see the all the all the all babies that I take care always and sometimes I go one hour with Joan in my arms.\n\n55:23 That used to be don't do it. It was the same too. So actually when before we sleep trained him, it was like that where my wife would have to like rock him to sleep and then she would make him fall asleep like on her first like she would rock him. And once he would fall asleep, then she would be like she would quietly sneak him into the crib. And if he woke up, he would be like this he'd be like and then once he wakes up, it's over. Like he's pissed off, he's angry and he starts screaming. So you have to do it like so gentle. And then I told her I was like, I said, look, we have to sleep train him because otherwise he's going to cry every time that he wakes up and he's in the crib and you're not there. So we sleep trained him.\n\n56:06 Yes.\n\n56:07 It only took like two days. In two days of sleep training him, he was like really, really good.\n\n56:13 Oh, he he he he was he she he is very gentle and calm baby.\n\n56:22 Yeah, I would say like his demeanor is he's very happy. He laughs a lot and he smiles a lot and he tries to make you laugh too. Like he knows he knows how to be funny. So he'll try to do things to make you laugh. But he's also really stubborn. So like if you you know, maybe this is how all babies are, but like if you take something away from him that he wants, he gets so mad. Like he throws his head like this.\n\n56:49 He gets so angry.\n\n56:54 The word is full part.\n\n56:55 Yes, exactly. Exactly.\n\n56:58 Yes, I I took this days with Joan. Sometimes it's just uh spoon and I need to spoon for do a thing and when I beg that for his his his hand, oh my god, is the you know, he cry and cry all\n\n57:21 Exactly.\n\n57:22 It's very\n\n57:23 Exactly. It's like very\n\n57:26 90% happy, 10% angry.\n\n57:30 Yes, Joan sounds like this. He was a very happy baby. I I have contact until today with then with uh the three families that I worked with when I was a nanny. I have contact. So I'm always seeing wow, how is how is they are going because it's uh being a nanny and being a teacher is very different because when it was a nanny where we have the contact so much and the connection is so big because you spend a lot of time with this kid and you you be a reference, you know? I see in the eyes of Joan and Nina and Max and Yara, they see me and they knew that she can help me if I got a problem. So I think it's a very important job this.\n\n58:31 For sure. Yeah, I mean they bond with you. It's you know, you you become a really important person in their life.\n\n58:38 Yes, yes. I think is is beautiful. I love my my kids and I love my students, but they are a lot of they are bigger so\n\n58:48 Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\n58:53 Well, what any other questions?\n\n58:56 I think I think um no, I think it's good. I have a document that I can send you that are a few questions that I think is too much for the call and we or we can do another call and discuss the the questions or you you can write the the the questions and if you if you want to me uh questions too because I know when we have a call, we don't make every questions that we have and we got there we you know and I was uh think with one question and I forgot. Oh, how I always curious about that. How do you and your wife um met?\n\n59:56 That's a good question.\n\n59:59 So\n\n01:00:00 Her friend is my best friend's little sister.\n\n01:00:09 Oh.\n\n01:00:09 Yeah. So my best friend, my best friend Nate, we've been best friends since we were like 13 years old. And then her and his Nate's sister, Samantha, have been best friends since they were like, I don't know, five years old, six years old, like for a long time. And so then when we were adults, I never met her when we were when we were kids. I never really went to Nate's house. And so then when we were adults, it was probably when I was like 25 and she was like 18. I'm seven years older than her. And so now I'm 39 and she's 32.\n\n01:00:51 Yeah, we we met then when I was like 25 and she was 18. But when I saw her when she was 18, like to me she was like a little kid. So I didn't think like, it was like, oh, you know, I wanted to like ask her on a date. Like I thought she was a kid because she was so young. And now when you're older, like the seven years doesn't feel so far. But when you're young, it feels like a lot, you know.\n\n01:01:11 And then and then when we were uh I think I was like 30 or 31 and I broke up with a girl that I was living with. I was in this a long relationship and we broke up and she was in a five years relationship, another long one and they broke up like a month apart. Like super very close where we broke up almost at the same time. And then she messaged me because we were just friends and you know, and she said, hey, I'm coming to uh moving to downtown. And um I was living in downtown. This is in San Diego at the time.\n\n01:01:47 I'm telling her I'm telling her a story about how we met.\n\n01:01:50 Is he still awake?\n\n01:01:55 She keeps coming and then leaving. Sorry.\n\n01:01:58 So so then she messaged me and said, hey, I'm moving to downtown like, you know, maybe you can show me around. And I said, oh yeah, like I have these bikes. I had these electric bikes. And so I was like, we should go ride electric bikes. And so we did and then like we totally like hit it off. And when we first met, I remember when we first started hanging out, I remember telling her like, hey, like we both just got out of a relationship. Like we should not like jump back into one, you know? Maybe that would be a mistake for us. And she's like, no, I I totally agree. Like we need to go really slow and like let's not like, you know, let's not get back into something when we just, you know, got out of something. But we couldn't help it. Like we fell in love and then like we were like, it's okay. Like this is okay.\n\n01:02:43 Oh, how beautiful. You it was destined, right? Because they you you knew about her when you was a kid, but you don't know her. And then we go adult and you don't\n\n01:02:58 Exactly.\n\n01:03:01 So beautiful.\n\n01:03:02 Yeah.\n\n01:03:03 And I I I remember where I was talked to you because this program they have the you you talked the 45 hours. Is this right?\n\n01:03:19 And is very okay for me because I don't know I I I see a lot the girls were complaining about this, but I don't know because here now I I do 44 hours. So it's very normal.\n\n01:03:36 How how my jobs always go to like four or 44 hours. So it's not a problem for me doing the 45. I don't know. I always do never got a normal job because a normal job is 44 hours here in Brazil.\n\n01:03:55 Yeah.\n\n01:03:55 I love to talk with your your wife and meet her too.\n\n01:04:02 Yeah.\n\n01:04:02 It's very important to me meet her and talk with her. And she can talk to me too and I love to answer their she their she questions, their questions, their questions, right?\n\n01:04:18 Yes.\n\n01:04:19 So her questions.\n\n01:04:21 I if you if you want, I love to do another call with her.\n\n01:04:26 Yeah, no, we would we would love to. I think maybe Wednesday would be a good day. I don't know what's your schedule like on Wednesday, but we could Wednesday we might be able to do it when he's awake and then you can meet him too. We can bring him on the camera.\n\n01:04:41 Yes, it's very it's very I go to the the school that I work, the schools go in vacation at Wednesday. So I will I will be free anytime.\n\n01:04:58 Okay.\n\n01:05:00 When Thursday and so when when you decide because I know that you message you on WhatsApp.\n\n01:05:09 Yes.\n\n01:05:10 Well, we leave Thursday. So Wednesday at least we're still here and we're settled, you know. But I'll message you on WhatsApp with some times and see if those work for you after I talk to her.\n\n01:05:20 Yes, yes, okay.\n\n01:05:22 Okay, cool. Yeah, that sounds good.\n\n01:05:24 Um well, yeah, I mean, I don't I have more questions just like you said, but I think it's too much for one conversation, you know.\n\n01:05:32 Yes, yes. It's very difficult these interviews.\n\n01:05:37 Yeah, it is. It is. It's a lot of time actually. You put a lot of time into these conversations, right?\n\n01:05:43 Yes, there's a lot of energy and I don't I don't know you and the first time we see each other. So it's a lot of, you know, the things that I want to ask but they have the time. So\n\n01:05:59 Yeah, exactly.\n\n01:06:00 Yeah, well, we can save the rest of our questions for the next conversation that we have.\n\n01:06:06 Okay, this is perfect. I very anxious to know your wife and your baby. He's so cute, so\n\n01:06:17 Thanks. Yeah, you'll\n\n01:06:17 Thank you for the talk.\n\n01:06:19 Yeah, thank you too. You you'll like her. She's she's much nicer than I am is what everyone says.\n\n01:06:25 Not that I not that I'm not nice. Like I am nice, but she she's like she's like too nice. Like I tell her that's her problem in life, you know? Like you're too nice to people and then they try to take advantage of you, you know.\n\n01:06:39 She's really really sweet.\n\n01:06:41 Yes, I'm looking forward to talk with her and I think it this we can talk uh with our message. I I can send you the file with the questions or you can start\n\n01:06:57 Yeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:58 Okay.\n\n01:06:59 Okay, yeah, you send you is a file with with questions that is very common, I think.\n\n01:07:07 I was made all let me think the best questions and I put together in on this file. So that's it.\n\n01:07:17 Okay. Well, yeah, it was great connecting with you and having a conversation and then we'll look forward to talking again Wednesday.\n\n01:07:25 Yes, sorry if I talk too much because I know that I talk.\n\n01:07:30 You didn't and your and your English is is I think it's it's better than you think it is. Like you don't give yourself enough credit. But yeah, obviously obviously if you want to improve your English, like of course you have a lot more to learn.\n\n01:07:44 But I have uh my friends who well, so a guy named named Kaio from Brazil who he works for me. He moved to the US because when he was first working for me in Brazil, he was like very he's very good at his job. And he was really valuable to the company. And so, you know, he told me like he was tell me that him and his wife, they really would their dream is to move to America. And I said, well, maybe I can get you like a, you know, a green card because of your because you're like essential to the business. You have to be like really important to a company to be able to do it. And so we went to a lawyer and we went through the process and we actually got him a green card. So him and his wife, they live they live in Vegas now. They're really really close friends with me and my wife.\n\n01:08:30 And Isabella. And uh they their English like two years ago was like like yours, which is like it's okay. It's okay, you know. But their English now is so good. Like in two years their English has gotten so so good. Like they still have a Brazilian accent, of course, but they speak like fluent fluent English. It's really impressive how fast they learned.\n\n01:08:53 Yes, the practice every day is very important and I and I don't practice every day. So\n\n01:09:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're I guess it does make sense why so many people see the value of doing this this program to improve their English because when you're here, like you're only speaking English, you know? The only person that you're going to speak Portuguese with is going to be the baby because you're teaching them.\n\n01:09:18 You know.\n\n01:09:22 Anyways, okay.

This shows empathy and a willingness to go out of her way to support others, earning her a strong score of 4.",
              "2": "She mentions working in two schools with varying shifts (morning, afternoon, night) which suggests a level of responsibility in managing her professional commitments (10:56). Additionally, her role as a nanny and her initiative to help Nina indicates responsibility in caregiving, supporting a score of 4.",
              "3": "Ana Claudia briefly mentions helping her mother when she sees a need, though she doesn’t elaborate (07:31). There’s limited depth about her family connections, so this competency is rated as average with a score of 3.",

Without concrete examples of exceeding expectations or falling short, I assign a score of 2 for below average due to lack of evidence.",

This earns an average score of 3.",

Okay, cool.\n\n00:31 Um do you know are you how far you are from us?\n\n00:36 Let me see you were in where?\n\n00:40 I'm in um I am in Silver Silverado Ranch. I don't know if you heard about it.\n\n00:47 Silver Silverado Ranch it's called?\n\n00:50 Yes.\n\n00:51 Or Ridge?\n\n00:53 Ranch.\n\n00:53 Oh ranch ranch. Okay.\n\n00:55 Yeah I can tell you how far it is from us.\n\n00:58 Yeah. We are 23 minute drive.\n\n01:03 Mhm.\n\n01:03 Is that too far for you?\n\n01:06 No not really.\n\n01:07 You don't mind that or?\n\n01:09 No I don't mind.\n\n01:11 Okay.\n\n01:12 Um yeah because we're right off of the uh 215 like the like off of Durango the 215 and Durango.\n\n01:20 Uh-huh. I get it.\n\n01:22 Yeah. So I don't get it.\n\n01:24 Okay cool. So let's um let me ask some questions that I have prepared.\n\n01:29 Um so the first one I was going to ask was if you've cared for kids his age but I know you're watching a girl now who's 10 months so very similar.\n\n01:38 Um I guess are there any other you know kids around his age toddlers you know that you've watched in the past?\n\n01:46 Yeah I used to take care of uh one year and three months boy in Brazil. I also took care of a seven a seven months girl in Brazil too.\n\n02:00 Okay. Okay.\n\n02:02 Um when did you move here?\n\n02:06 A year ago.\n\n02:07 Okay cool.\n\n02:10 Uh did you move here through the op op au pair service?\n\n02:14 Yes.\n\n02:15 Oh I feel like there's I've talked to a few people like that I've interviewed who that's the same thing.\n\n02:20 How does that work like do you come here working for a family and then\n\n02:25 Yeah we come here through agency.\n\n02:27 Uh-huh.\n\n02:28 And then we leave with the host family in the same house.\n\n02:33 Okay I see.\n\n02:35 And then and then after the uh program ends you don't have to go back?\n\n02:41 Well it's my choice if I want to or not you know.\n\n02:44 Yeah I see. Okay.\n\n02:48 Um okay cool. And then um the next question is like what what are some things that you like to do with a baby you know his age like what would you what would you want to do with your days with him?\n\n03:01 Well in Brazil for example I used to do like sensory activities for babies with a group of babies. So I like to explore uh this area with them because it's a nice age to to do this.\n\n03:17 Mhm.\n\n03:18 You know like texture colors uh what else uh like small activities like playing this kind of stuff. So it's something that I used to do when I was in Brazil.\n\n03:36 Okay. Okay nice.\n\n03:38 Um and then um the next thing I was going to ask was related to like you know kids his age they can have tantrums right so like how do you deal with a baby that's throwing a fit or like getting really you know having a tantrum?\n\n03:59 Having what?\n\n04:00 A tantrum.\n\n04:01 Uh where they're like you know they're crying and screaming and like are angry.\n\n04:08 Well I always think that when you like work with kids you have to be open to be patient and understand that if you freak out it's not going to help at all. So trying to pass through the kid this uh like being calm be patient try to bring them to the same I don't know if I can say that but the same vibe that's something that can help for sure.\n\n04:40 Mhm.\n\n04:40 So I think that that's the key for everything.\n\n04:44 Yeah. That's good.\n\n04:45 Yeah.\n\n04:46 That's good. Okay.\n\n04:48 I mean I don't have a lot of other questions I guess when are you looking to I know you're working with this other family now but it's not like a you know full-time schedule or anything like that so when are you looking to uh uh to start a job?\n\n05:03 Well I'm available now. I'm doing some interviews with other families because I start to like applying for some now but I'm free. So I'm doing some interviews and trying to figure it out how it's going to be my schedule but now I'm pretty much available.\n\n05:24 Okay. Okay gotcha.\n\n05:25 Yeah.\n\n05:25 Perfect. Um do you have any questions for me?\n\n05:30 Uh well let me see. There is something you saying about uh light housekeeping right?\n\n05:37 Yeah.\n\n05:39 So can you explain like how it's going to be what do you expect me to do?\n\n05:45 Yeah I mean it would mostly be related to the baby so just like his his dishes his bottles his laundry and then keeping his uh his area like clean.\n\n05:57 Uh-huh.\n\n05:57 That's really nice.\n\n05:58 I understand.\n\n05:59 Yeah.\n\n06:00 And what about like nap times if he has some like food restrictions?\n\n06:06 Yeah he does I mean naps he takes two naps a day and so he naps around like 9 a.m. and around like 2-ish p.m. and then he's he does have some food allergies. He's allergic to dairy and then he's allergic to um uh wheat which we're trying to like work on that but um his main allergy is dairy right now.\n\n06:33 Oh okay.\n\n06:34 Yeah.\n\n06:35 So he takes like some kind of medicine you have like for uh if something happen you have something that they can reach out?\n\n06:44 Yeah I mean we have an epi pen if if he has like a really bad allergic reaction we do have those at our house.\n\n06:51 Okay perfect.\n\n06:52 Yeah.\n\n06:53 Yeah.\n\n06:54 Okay.\n\n06:55 Yeah.\n\n06:57 I don't think we're going to have any question for now.\n\n07:00 Okay.\n\n07:01 Yeah.\n\n07:01 Perfect. So then I guess what we'll do what I'll do is um I've got like a handful of interviews that I have to do this week and then we'll you know once I've wrapped up the interviews then if I want to move to a second you know interview with you then I can reach out to you and let you know.\n\n07:19 Yeah it's perfect sounds good.\n\n07:21 Okay cool. Well thank you and it was nice talking to you.\n\n07:23 Thank you. Have a nice day.\n\n07:25 You too. Bye.\n\n07:27 Bye.\n\n\nPowered by Spark +AI Meeting Notes \n\n",
